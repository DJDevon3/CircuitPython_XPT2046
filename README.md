Circuit Python SPI Driver for XPT2046 Touch Screen Controller

Designed for use with the 4.0" 480x320 [ST7796S display with integrated XPT2046 Touch controller & SDCard Reader](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832829271342.html) from AliExpress
- It's actually a 3.5" display on a 4" PCB... marketing.
- Even though I'm using it with an ST7796S display you can use this driver for many different displays that use this touch controller chip.

I designed a Feather adapter board that would interface with the display board.

Basically becomes a TFT Featherwing you can use with your Feather of choice.
